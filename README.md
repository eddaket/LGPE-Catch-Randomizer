# Let's Go Catch Randomizer

[Live Site](https://lgpe-catch-randomizer.fly.dev/)

The **Let's Go Catch Randomizer** is a tool designed to randomize which Pokémon encounters in the _Pokémon Let's Go_ games are required to beat the game. In a normal playthrough/speedrun of Pokémon Let's Go, the player is required to catch at least 50 unique Pokémon in order to satisfy all of the Gym Requirements; this tool picks 50 available Pokémon randomly. Currently, the only supported tracker is [Spiderc's Let's Go Tracker](https://lets-go-tracker.web.app/tracker), however other trackers will be supported in the future.

**NOTE**: This randomizer does not modify the games in anyway. All it does is supply the user with a list of 50 Pokémon to catch. This is purely a self-imposed restriction on how to play through the games.

### Features:

- **Generate Randomized Seed** – Create a unique seed to randomize your Pokémon encounters. Supports both Pikachu! and Eevee! versions.
- **Downloadable Tracker Files** – Download the randomized tracker file for use in _Spiderc's Let's Go Tracker_.
- **Easy Sharing** – Share your seed with others using the generated URL.

### Usage:

1. Go to the [Let's Go Catch Randomizer](https://lgpe-catch-randomizer.fly.dev/) website.
2. Apply any settings you wish to match the desired randomizer experience.
3. Generate a seed.
4. Download the randomized tracker JSON file.
5. Use the file with the _Pokémon Let's Go Tracker_.
